# Lit Development

Lit solutions for design and development.

Current project is [Delta Ignited](https://github.com/Lit-Development/Delta-Ignited), a personal graphics overhaul of [Delta](https://github.com/rileytestut/Delta), with some community features cherry-picked from other forks like [Deltroid](https://github.com/lonkelle/Deltroid) to create a unique and beautiful experience for users.

In the future I plan for this to be the home of any professional endeavors I embark on. I hope you enjoy something that I make.
